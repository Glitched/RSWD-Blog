title: The Ultimate Domain Name Guide
---

Domains can seem difficult, but are simple once you break it down. First things first, domains have two parts to them. The first is called a second level domain or a root domain and it is everything that comes before the dot such as **ryanslama**.com. The second part is the ending such as .com, .net, .org, and .edu. Recently, many new generic TLD's (gTLD) have become available, which you can see at [Name.com](http://www.name.com/new-gtld).

##Choosing a TLD
I recommend a .com or .org domain for most sites because people are familiar with them. I tend not to go with gTLD's because some users may not understand that [learncode.academy](http://learncode.academy/){:rel="nofollow"} is a real site. Additionally, search engines may view an uncommon TLD as an indication that your website is spam.

##Choosing a Root Domain
Next, it is time to choose a root domain. Here are the main points to keep in mind:

+ Use the name of your brand
+ Keep your domain short to reduce typos
+ Make it memorable
- Stay away from Hyphens (-) as they can indicate spam
- Don't use numbers because of their ambiguity
- Don't worry about Exact Match Domains

Brand domains are a good way to hit all the checkboxes. They are usually short and to the point, but unique at the same time. Brands dominate Google search results as they indicate quality content. [Seobook](http://www.seobook.com/learn-seo/infographics/brand-branding-brands.php) has an excellent visual history that shows the rise of big brands in Google's search&nbsp;and why&nbsp;it&nbsp;happened. 

Can you think of any websites off the top of your head that use a hyphen? I can't. Hyphens are commonly used in low quality spam sites, but rarely used in high quality websites. Numbers are similar, but have an additional problem. If someone tells you to go to "One and One dot com" do they mean 1and1.com or oneandone.com? (Note: I do not recommend 1&1 hosting&nbsp;at&nbsp;all)

The truth about Exact Match Domains (EMD's) is that they have not been relevant in a long time. Years ago, BestCoffeePot.com would have been a top Google result for "Best Coffee Pot," but those days are safely behind us. Now, Google only values EMD's from popular brands that people would actually search for.

Now, EMD's can even make it more difficult to rank as keyword stuffing becomes more of a problem. [Bing's Webmaster Blog](http://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/2014/09/09/url-keyword-stuffing-spam-filtering/) says that they straight up penalize obvious EMD's.

##The Registration Process

It's not hard to register your domain, provided you know where to go. Whatever you do, DO NOT use Godaddy to register your domain. They charge well over the competition and have regular problems with their service. A quick search online will reveal too many people who have been burned by them. 

I use [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com) but their service is invite-only. My next favorite registrar is [Hover](https://www.hover.com/). Both of these options include Whois privacy (protects your personal information) and powerful DNS options for free. Google offers free email forwarding, but hover charges $5/yr per forward. Hover charges $20/yr to have a unique email to your site, but Google Apps cost $5/month.

Some webhosts may offer a free domain with your purchase of hosting, but I would register your domain separately if you think you may want to change hosts down the line. I have posted a [guide on hosting]({% post_url 2014-10-26-hosting-guide %}) to help you discover the best option for you.
