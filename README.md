# The Code behind [Ryanslama.com](http://www.ryanslama.com)

My site is generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the static site generator. I built my theme on top of @mdo's Poole.

I have used Poole as a code base, but have adapted it to support IE 8, as I cannot bring myself to break compatibility with it just yet. I have added Animate.CSS and Wow.JS for fancy page animations. I added Source Sans Pro as a web font, and use that for most of the text in the theme.
